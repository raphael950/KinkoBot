# KinkoBot

A Discord bot built with [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA). It was developed voluntarily for a past project and is not intended for active use or further development.

## Features

- **Captcha Verification System**: Implements a captcha challenge to prevent bots from joining the server. The captcha is generated as an image, and users must enter the correct code using a slash command.
- **Role Selection**: Enables users to select their roles via slash commands and interactive Discord buttons.


> [!CAUTION]
> This bot was created as a volunteer effort for an old project and is not maintained for public use. If you choose to use or modify it, you do so at your own discretion.
